# Heart Disease Prediction

**Heart Diseases are too risky for a human being, from a given data we will predict that person have heart disease or not with the help of Machine Learning. There is a predictive system**

**In this project we are playing with different Machine Learning Classification Algorithms, and we are going to pick only one algorithm which is having better performance, check it out!**

**So stay fit!**
