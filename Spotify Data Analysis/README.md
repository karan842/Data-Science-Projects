# Top 30 Spotify songs - 2019ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§

Dataset collected from Kaggle

## Our task is to analyze the records available in dataset, visulize the data with the help of Python programming language.

- In this data analysis task, first of all I converted all column names into lower case.
- Calculated numebr of songs of each genre and artist.
- Dealing with Null values in the dataset.
- Visulization is very important part, here I visualized data by matplotlub and seaborn.
- Applied Machine Learning Algorithms.
- Build machine learning model which predicts **Popularity** of song(s).
- Comparing Actual and Predicted popularity.
- Visualize the result again for better understanding.

## There are lots of possible techniques to build a suitable machine learning model which can predict Popularity of song.

Corrections and sugesstions are welcome.


Listening songs/podcasts on Spotify while coding helps me a lot to refresh my mood ;) What about you?
