# Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

Collected data from Kaggle and this data is from cardekho.com

## There are many types of cars present in this data, our task is to first explore the given data with help of EDA techniques and visualizations by Python

### Data is not that big, so there is not necessary to use Neural Networks but for practicing ANN. I used Neural Networks.

This a regression problem so you can use **Linear Regression**, **XG Boost Regressor**.

Happy Coding!
