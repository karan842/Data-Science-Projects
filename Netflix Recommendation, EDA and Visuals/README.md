# üîµAbout Project:
This is a recommendation system project based on Netflix dataset from **Kaggle**, **IMDb** dataset, **Books** dataset. Netflix is one the popular online Movies & TV Shows streaming platform.
There are thousands of TV Shows and Movies on Netflix those are watched by all over the world. According to Wikipedia net worth of Netflix in 2020 is USD2.761 billion (2020).

Project also contains dataset of **BOOKS** for finding out how many movies/shows on Netflix are inspired by booksüìö. We are using two datasets of **IMDb** data one is **IMDb ratings** and other is **IMDb movies**.

 In this project I did comparison based Visualization with help of Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud and Plotly. This project is a **Natural Language Processing** based concept. You can see that all datasets are in the form of text so here I used NLP techniques for making **Netflix Recommendation System**. 
 
 While coding recommendation system I performed two techniques first is **TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** by using this method model performed very well but for accuracy I created other model the second technique which was **CountVectorizer** and **Cosine Similarity**.
